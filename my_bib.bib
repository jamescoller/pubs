	abstract = {Under ONR sponsorship, the US Navy has been developing a real-time multi-ship Environmental and Ship Motion Forecasting system (ESMF). The multiship aspect, particularly skin-to-skin operations, required the development of a fast, nonlinear, panel method to estimate the Response Amplitude Operators (RAOs) necessary for ship motion predictions. This new panel method, named Motionsim, is described.},

	abstract = {The US Navy has developed a real-time multi-ship ship motion forecasting system which combines forecast wave conditions with ship motion simulations to produce a prediction of the relative motions between two ships operating in a skin-to-skin configuration. The system utilizes two different simulation methods for predicting ship motions: MotionSim and Reduced Order Model (ROM) based on AEGIR. MotionSim is a fast three-dimensional panel method that is used to estimate the Response Amplitude Operators (RAOs) necessary for multi-ship motion predictions. The ROM works to maximize the accuracy of high fidelity ship motion prediction methods while maintaining the computational speed required for realtime forecasting.},

	abstract = {Creating an autonomous ASV for operations in marine environments presents a unique set of design challenges. This paper provides an overview of the design and development of the University of Michigan’s autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) for the 2018 AUVSI Maritime RobotX Challenge. The evolution of the design over the course of the project is outlined in the context of the design strategy and reasoning for design decisions made to address the unique challenges. Detailed descriptions are provided to outline both the physical layout of the vessel as well as the logic used to design the systems onboard to support autonomous functionality. This encompasses vessel design, sensor selection, software architecture, and the logic for completing the competition tasks. The testing of these systems is described as it pertains to design changes, validation and veriﬁcation (V\&V), and ongoing work.},

Both commercial and military vessels are required to launch and recover a variety of manned and unmanned platforms including submersibles, small boats, aircraft, and amphibious vehicles. A fundamental attribute of these launch and recovery operations is their dependence on a number of probabilistic factors such as environmental conditions and design factors associated with the vessel and the platforms. To facilitate effective launch and recovery operations, ship designers require a design method that takes into account these probabilistic factors to gain a better understanding the implications of launch and recovery on a variety of early stage design decisions. Recent advancements in design tools and methodologies have pushed critical decisions earlier in the design process which necessitates evaluating mission critical systems sooner as well.},

We regularly assess our students’ perceptions of their team experience, but we are aware that some social groups can be at a disadvantage when it comes to teamwork. We chose to look at gender in this particular research endeavour. Our assessment data is derived from an online team support tool hosted by our institution. To better use this tool and improve support for our teams, we investigated the relationship between gender and student rating of teamwork behaviors.},

	abstract = {Introduction to engineering courses are increasingly team-based and project-based, with student teams designing and building real-world things. A popular project for introductory courses is remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). Our section of an intro to engineering class at a large Midwestern research university uses ROVs because they are fundamentally interdisciplinary: a successful design includes elements of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, naval architecture, marine engineering, and others. However, over the years we have observed that students continued to struggle with an early understanding of the forces and moments that impact how ROVs move through the water – in other words, hydrodynamics. This lack of hydrodynamic understanding leads them to design vehicles that are frustrating to drive because they are not hydrodynamically stable.},

	abstract = {This research paper presents insights obtained from an online team support tool in an undergraduate setting. In this research, the authors examined patterns of self- and peerreporting regarding preferences for speaking in groups, as well as downstream effects such as perceived voice safety and voice enactment. In both course contexts, the data show that students who initially identiﬁed as more extroverted did speak up more in groups, felt a higher sense of belonging, and had their ideas enacted more often. Importantly, by the end of the semester, women and international students reported less extroversion compared to other groups, which may indicate that these students have experiences on their teams that affects their perception of extroversion. These patterns were consistent in both the introductory engineering and business courses, and suggest that instructors should pay attention to team conversational dynamics to promote equity in team conversations.},
