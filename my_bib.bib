	abstract = {Under ONR sponsorship, the US Navy has been developing a real-time multi-ship Environmental and Ship Motion Forecasting system (ESMF). The multiship aspect, particularly skin-to-skin operations, required the development of a fast, nonlinear, panel method to estimate the Response Amplitude Operators (RAOs) necessary for ship motion predictions. This new panel method, named Motionsim, is described.},

	abstract = {The US Navy has developed a real-time multi-ship ship motion forecasting system which combines forecast wave conditions with ship motion simulations to produce a prediction of the relative motions between two ships operating in a skin-to-skin configuration. The system utilizes two different simulation methods for predicting ship motions: MotionSim and Reduced Order Model (ROM) based on AEGIR. MotionSim is a fast three-dimensional panel method that is used to estimate the Response Amplitude Operators (RAOs) necessary for multi-ship motion predictions. The ROM works to maximize the accuracy of high fidelity ship motion prediction methods while maintaining the computational speed required for realtime forecasting.},

Most of the peer mentoring relationships investigated in the literature are of mentors not tied to a specific course [e.g.,2]. This paper reports on how one section of a first year, intensive, projectbased learning class uses peer mentors to guide student teams throughout a design-build-test project in a first year engineering course.},

While a majority of students rated each of the strategies as useful, the two strategies rated highest were peer mentoring and progress meetings with the instructors.},

	abstract = {Vessel performance in shipboard launch and recovery operations is a critical element of its overall mission eﬀectiveness. Both commercial and military vessels are required to launch and recover a variety of manned and unmanned platforms including submersibles, small boats, aircraft, and amphibious vehicles. A fundamental attribute of these launch and recovery operations is their dependence on a number of probabilistic factors such as environmental conditions and design factors associated with the vessel and the platforms. To facilitate eﬀective launch and recovery operations, ship designers require a design method that takes into account these probabilistic factors to gain a better understanding the implications of launch and recovery on a variety of early stage design decisions. Recent advancements in design tools and methodologies have pushed critical decisions earlier in the design process which necessitates evaluating mission critical systems sooner as well.},
